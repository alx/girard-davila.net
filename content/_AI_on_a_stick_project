**Welcome to the "AI on a Stick" project - A DIY Nomad Photo Booth!**

Imagine stepping into a retrofuturistic nomad photo booth where Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings your photos to life. 
Our setup uses the "stable diffusion" model to create photorealistic images from our webcam feed.

**The Magic of AI:**
Our AI-powered nomad photo booth transforms reality into unique and mesmerizing images with every pose, expression, and interaction. With our system, you'll discover the incredible capabilities of AI in a fun and interactive way.
